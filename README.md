# The-Banal-Bearbug
Human-factor DIY keyboards for two-hand and single-hand writers: Dvorak 2024 and the Banal Bearbug.

The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard has made it possible for me to write for over thirty years. Why are writers born in the third decade of the 21st century forced into the 150 year old Qwerty mechanical typewriter continuum?

The Banal Bearbug is an abomination. It is the culmination of Qwerty
